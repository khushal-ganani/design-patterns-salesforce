# Design Patterns 

Design patterns are **proven solutions to recurring problems** in software design, which are high-quality, reusable, loosely-coupled and maintainable object-oriented software systems. They capture design experience in a usable form, providing a **standard vocabulary for developers**. Essentially, a design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design. The well-known "Gang of Four" (GoF) patterns consist of 23 such patterns, grouped into three categories: **Creational, Structural, and Behavioural**.

## Why Design Patterns?

Learning design patterns is essential for several reasons:

- **Improved Code Quality**: Using design patterns often results in **more maintainable, flexible, and extensible code**. They help promote **loose coupling** and encapsulate design decisions, making codebases easier to understand, modify, and extend. They embody best practices and principles of software design. For Example, most of the Salesforce Apex frameworks that organizations follow are built following these design patterns.
- **Enhanced Understanding and Development**: Knowing design patterns makes it easier to **understand existing object-oriented systems**. They can help you become a better designer, enabling novices to act more like experts. They are also useful for transitioning from analysis models to implementation models and can provide targets for refactoring, making designs more robust to change.
- **Reusable Solutions**: They offer **tested solutions to common design issues**, preventing developers from having to "reinvent the wheel". By applying these patterns, you can reuse successful designs and architectures.
- **Standardized Terminology**: They **provide a common language for developers**, which enhances collaboration and understanding among team members. This allows you to talk about designs at a higher level of abstraction.
- **Cross-Domain Applicability**: Many patterns are **language and domain-agnostic**, making them valuable tools in diverse development environments. These principles can be applied to any OOP language, and also Salesforce Apex or LWC development.

In summary, design patterns are valuable because they provide reusable solutions, a common language, and guide developers toward creating flexible, maintainable, loosely-coupled and high-quality software systems.

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles (OOPS!)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are fundamental concepts that underpin the design of object-oriented software systems. Before diving into design patterns, it is crucial to understand some of these core principles. Understanding these OOP principles is critical because design patterns are built upon these fundamental techniques. Learning OOP principles first helps you understand why these problems exist and how patterns use principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to solve them

Here are the OOPS concepts that you need to know before starting on Design Patterns :
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Coupling
- Composition
